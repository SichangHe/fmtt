# ForMaT Text

A diff-friendly text formatter that breaks lines on sensible punctuations and words to fit a line width.

This is more useful to use with Git than `fmt` because the formatting is more consistent, resulting in smaller diffs.

- Respect line width limit.
- Prioritize splitting on
    1. sentence ends like `.`, then
    1. sub-sentence ends like `,`, then
    1. sub-sentence starts like `(`, and finally
    1. sentence-connection words like `and`.
- Limited support for abbreviations using heuristics.

## Installation

```sh
cargo install fmtt
```

## Usage

```sh
$ fmtt --help
ForMaT Text diff-friendly,
breaking lines on sensible punctuations and words to fit a line width.

Like fmt, FMTT is a text formatter;
it formats its input to have lines shorter than the line width limit
(if possible).
It reads an input file or StdIn and prints the formatted text to StdOut.
Like LaTeX,
FMTT does not distinguish different whitespaces or their amount except for
double line breaks; it only preserves leading spaces, not tabs.

This help message is formatted using FMTT itself as an example.


Usage: fmtt [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -w, --line-width <LINE_WIDTH>
          Maximum line width limit.
          
          [default: 80]

  -f, --filename <FILENAME>
          Name of input file; if omitted, read from StdIn.

  -c, --change-in-place
          If input file is provided, write output to it.

  -p, --allow-indented-paragraphs
          Allow indented paragraphs.
          If not set, any change indentation changes start a new paragraph.

  -m, --markdown-friendly
          Treat `# `/`## `/â€¦/`###### `/`---`/`===`-started lines as single paragraphs;
          treat `- `/`* `/regex`\d+\. `-started lines as paragraph starts.
          Useful for Markdown, especially with `-p`.

  -l, --latex-friendly
          Ignore `%`-started lines;
          treat `\` started lines as paragraph starts.
          Useful for LaTeX.

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
```
